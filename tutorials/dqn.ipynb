    "## What is DQN?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see DQN as Q-learning algorithm with a Neural Network plays the role of action-value function approximator, which enables the agent learn to choose actions from high-dimentional raw-image input. In Q-learning, $Q^*(s,a)$ represents the accumulated future reward, $Q^*$, if in state $s$ the system first performs action $a$, and subsequently follows an optimal policy. For small state space, tabular RL uses a look-up table to update $Q(s,a)$, which fails when the state space become very large. So here in DQN, the system tries to approximate $Q^*$ by using an artificial neural network - a function approximator to do generalization on states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function for the function approximator - deep q-network is: $$\\mathcal{L}_i(w_i) = \\mathbb{E}_{s,a,r,s'\\thicksim\\mathcal{D}_i}[(r+\\gamma \\max_{a'}Q(s',a';w_i^-)-Q(s,a;w_i))]^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation: \n",
    "- $i$ indicate the time; \n",
    "- $\\mathcal{D}_i$ means the replay buffer for [experience replay](https://medium.com/@Fihezro/experience-replay-deep-reinforcement-learning-ef02b8a1383); \n",
    "- $s'$ is the next state after taking action $a$ at state $s$, note that in dynamic environment, the $s'$ may not be determined by $s$ and $a$; \n",
    "- $w_i^-$ is the parameter of network for Q-learning target, which will not be updated frequently, but when updated, it will be set as $w_i$, the parameter of Q-Network;\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ is the discount factor;\n",
    "- $r+\\gamma \\max_{a'}Q(s',a';w_i^-)$ means the 'ground truth', assume the optimalization of later actions;\n",
    "- $Q(s,a;w_i)$ is the evaluation result of Q-network, and the $w_i$ is the parameter updated through gradient descent."
