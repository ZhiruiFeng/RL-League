Implementations of state-of-art Reinforcement Learning algorithms and architectures.

The related article is [Implementation of RL Agent with Modular Perspective](http://fzruniverse.life/2018/03/24/Modular-Architecture-for-Implementing-RL-Agent/).

### Outline

**The file architecture is**:
- /agents/: Includes various implementation of RL algorithms
- /lib/: Includes libraries for testing envs and helping function
- /field/: For testing, where uses RL agents to solve tasks

### Some articles about different modules:

More is coming later. You can check [here](http://fzruniverse.life/2018/03/23/Introduction/) to see the plan.
